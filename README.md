This Single Page Application, built using [Angular](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) (CLI version 9.1.7), will both display stock data for several companies and allow users to display MID and CLOSE stock values for companies when provided with a valid QUANDL url.

[Highcharts/Highstock](https://www.highcharts.com/) libraries are used to generate the charts and [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) API's are used as data sources
## Live Environment

## Development Server
